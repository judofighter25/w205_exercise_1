2.1. best_hospitalsTo determine which hospitals are the best, I first transformed the “Time and Effective Care” data into data with hospital identifier,
procedure ID, score…etc.  To determine which hospital are among the top, I took a average of the measures (scores) of all the procedures by hospitals and rank the hospital based on this average score.  
To remove potential data error, I remove anything that’s not text and and score that’s great than 100 in the final query.

Result:

hospitalname                         		     Avg_Score  Agg_Score 
TOWNER COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER				100.0	100
GORDON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL DISTRICT			100.0	100
NOVANT HEALTH HAYMARKET MEDICAL CENTER			100.0	700
SYLVAN GROVE HOSPITAL					100.0	100
RUMFORD  HOSPITAL					100.0	200
HILLSBORO AREA HOSPITAL					100.0	300
GRAND JUNCTION VA MEDICAL CENTER			100.0	800
CRETE AREA MEDICAL CENTER				100.0	700
MILLINOCKET REGIONAL HOSPITAL				100.0	600
ST LUKE'S WOOD RIVER MEDICAL CENTER			100.0	100

(Avg_Score: average score of various procedures per hospital)
(Agg_Score: aggregate score of various procedures per hospital)2.2. best_states
When looking at the best state with best hospitals.  I took the average hospital score (which itself is an average of measure of all procedures at a hospital) at the state level.  This is accomplished by utilizing the Avg_Hospital_Score table which was created to collect average procedures scores at hospital level.
In other words, state will be ranked by its average of average hospital procedure score.  
The result:

State  Avg_Hospital_Score_State_Level
VT	90.73569202974443
DE	88.14258776401633
NH	88.11079610343951

2.3. hospital_variability
For variability of procedures across hospitals, the analysis is performed by looking at the variance as well as the max and min score by procedure.  In other words, what’s the variance of a procedures across hospitals.  This is accomplished using the variance in Hive.  
In presenting the result, I decide to go with variance instead of difference between min and max.  Because variance capture the up and downs of the score while difference between min and max will only give procedures with perfect score and with zero.

The result:

MeasureID		procedure_variability    max  min
STK_4			481.98665882944397	100	0
OP_23			477.18888614639235	100	0

2.4. hospitals_and_patients
Hospital performance can be analyzed through the score which is column score derived from “Time and Effective Care”.  In addition, patient survey responses were collect and put into a table call surveys.  Three overall survey results: OverallRatingofHospitalAchievementPoints, OverallRatingofHospitalImprovementPoints, and OverallRatingofHospitalDimensionScore were collected to represent overall patient surveys.  Because I need to compare the results on a hospital level, I took an average of the patient surveys and put it into a table called avg_survey_score.  

Finally, avg_survey_score and avg_hospital_score were joined together through providerID to form a table called hospital_patient.  In the hospital_patient table, I run a correlation function in Hive (corr) between average procedure scores  vs. the average three survey results mentioned above at hospital level.  The result:

corr_achieve                       corr_improve                    corr_dimscore
0.07797961939245239	0.07170610226644719	0.05513478459803181

Overall, the average hospital score showed very little correlations with the average survey results of the 
three overall level surveys.  Base on the this finding, hospital scores seem to have little correlations with patient surveys(satisfactions).
